Telecom companies face constant pressure to evolve due to shifting customer needs and market competition. Retaining customers and preventing churn is critical. Customers typically move through phases: initial satisfaction, a decline in experience due to factors like service issues or charges, and finally, churn, where they switch to another provider. Predicting churn probability early and taking proactive measures can help operators retain customers.

This project analyzes mobile usage and recharge data to identify features that impact churn. Using machine learning, we aim to develop models that predict churn probability, enabling timely action to reduce customer attrition.
