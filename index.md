Telecom companies across the world are facing a need to constantly evolve due to the changing customer needs and competition in the market. Adopting a correct strategy is key not only towards increasing the customer base but also to retain the current customers and preventing churn.
A typical customer that churns from one mobile network to another goes through a good phase (where the customer is happy with the services) followed by an action phase (here the customer starts to sore due to various reasons such as unjust charges/service quality etc.) then the churn phase where the customer is said to have taken the services of different operator. By predicting the probability of churn and taking the right action in the good months or action months a Telecom operator may be successful in retaining the customer and prevent churn.
The project uses a dataset comprising of features focussing on the usage (call/internet) and recharge characteristics of mobile customers across months with an aim to extract some key features impacting the churn probability of the customer and then build ML models that can aptly predict the churn probability by learning from the training data.
